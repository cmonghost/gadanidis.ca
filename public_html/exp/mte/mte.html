    "<p> Thank you for your interest in our project! Our goal is to investigate attitudes, ideas, and opinions about different kinds of words and phrases that can be heard in the Toronto area. We are particularly interested in hearing from young people who live in the Greater Toronto Area. Our purpose is strictly academic and related to the sociolinguistic study of language. We have no intention of judging your responses! </p>" +
    "<p> The task involves filling out a survey about different words you may (or may not) have heard around Toronto. We’ll ask you about different associations you have with those words, what you think they mean, and how frequently you use and hear them. </p>" +
    "<p> We will also audio record you because some of the responses to questions will be oral rather than written. This is to ensure spontaneous responses and because we may analyze your speech sociolinguistically as part of our analysis. The audio recording will be transcribed in the UTM Linguistics Lab. </p>" +
    "<p> We will also ask you some basic demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity, language background, places lived etc.).</p>" +
    "<p> The survey will take about 30 minutes to complete.</p>" +
    "<p> The audio data, transcript and the survey response data will be permanently stored on an encrypted hard drive in the UTM Linguistics Lab and will be kept secure, confidential and anonymous, only available to Prof. Denis, his researcher assistants, and other researchers at Prof. Denis' professional discretion. Anyone who is granted access to the data will be bound to confidentiality. </p>" +
    "<p> Any personal identifies (for example personal names, addresses) that are audio recorded will be pseudonymized in the transcript. </p>" +
    "<p> Please note that Prof. Denis and/or his colleagues may eventually publish text transcripts of what is recorded or play audio at in an academic context for genuine scholarly purposes. Your data will be presented anonymously.</p>" +
    "<p> Participation is entirely voluntary and you can stop at any point if you’d like. If you stop before the survey is complete, your data will not be collected and will not be analyzed. Once you complete the survey, you will not be able to withdraw your participation because your data will be automatically aggregated.</p>" +
    "<p> To help ensure participant protection procedures are followed, (a) representative(s) from the University of Toronto Human Research Ethics Program may have access to your data and consent information.  This access will be subject to the same confidentiality as described for the research team above.</p>" +
    "<p> As a token of appreciation, you will be given a $5 gift card if you complete the survey! If you do not complete the survey, you will not be eligible for the gift card.</p>" +
