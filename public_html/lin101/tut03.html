		<h2> Phonotactics exercise </h2>

		<p>Phonotactics is an area of phonology (sound patterns) concerned with which sounds are permitted in which places within a language.</p>
		<p>To explore this, consider that English has many syllable onsets consisting of a consonant cluster with two consonants. Which combinations does English allow?</p>

		<p>Consider the possible combinations on your handout (first along the vertical, then along the horizontal axis). Can you think of words or names that begin with these combinations, or do they just not sound like English at all? Where are there cases where an onomatopoeic word or a loanword or a name from another language might work but English does not often allow words?</p>

		<p>Use symbols or shading to keep track of where English allows and does not allow clusters.</p>
