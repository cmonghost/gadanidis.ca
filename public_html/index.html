		<h2>Linguistics</h2><a name="lx"></a>
		<p>
		I'm an M.A. student in linguistics at the University of Toronto. My advisor is <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~ddenis/Site/Derek_Denis.html">Derek Denis</a>.

		My research interests lie mostly in language variation and change (LVC); that is, I study the social and linguistic predictors that underlie language variation, and how that variation leads to change over time.
		Particularly, I'm interested in stylistic variation, discourse-pragmatic markers (especially <em>um</em>, <em>uh</em> and other "sublexical" markers like <em>hm</em>), subject drop, and anything to do with language on the internet.
		</p>

		<p>
		For my M.A. degree paper, I'm working on a study of <em>um</em> and <em>uh</em> in instant messaging (IM).
		Recent variationist work (e.g., <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-00602001">Wieling et al., 2016</a>) has identified a change in progress: <em>um</em> is rising in frequency relative to <em>uh</em>, which might be related to an emerging functional difference between the two.
		My goal is to explore that idea using IM data, in which the use of the words seems to be more intentional:
		while some would argue we "automatically" produce them in speech, using them in IM requires more conscious effort and thus may provide clues as to their discourse-pragmatic function.
		</p>

		<p>
		Apart from LVC, I'm also interested in the linguistics of Japanese:
		both in phonology
		(e.g., mora-timing)
		and
		in syntax/semantics
		(e.g., sluicing and island effects, internally-headed relative clauses, and adjectival modifiers).
