		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p> Hi! I'm Tim Gadanidis (/ˌgædəˈniːdɪs/), an Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of Toronto.

		<p>
		<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1rodebvjw7estye/cv.pdf?dl=0">You can download my CV here.</a>
		</p>

		<p> The rest of this page is organized as follows:
		<a href="#lx">&sect;2</a> outlines my research interests and contains links to download papers/slides.
		<a href="#personal">&sect;3</a> provides a brief description of my personal info and non-linguistic interests.
		</p>



		<h2>Linguistics</h2><a name="lx"></a>
		<h3> Research interests </h3>

		<p>
		My research interests lie mostly in language variation and change (LVC); that is, I study the social and linguistic predictors that underlie language variation, as well as how that variation leads to change over time.
		Particularly, I'm interested in stylistic variation, discourse-pragmatic markers (especially <em>um</em>, <em>uh</em> and other &ldquo;sublexical&rdquo; markers like <em>hm</em>), subject drop, and anything to do with language on the internet.
		</p>

		<p>
		For my M.A. degree paper, I conducted a study of <em>um</em> and <em>uh</em> in instant messaging (IM) under the supervision of <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~ddenis/Site/Derek_Denis.html" target = "external">Derek Denis</a>.
		</p>
		Recent variationist work (e.g., <a href="http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-00602001" target = "external">Wieling et al., 2016</a>) has identified a change in progress: <em>um</em> is rising in frequency relative to <em>uh</em>, which might be related to an emerging functional difference between the two.
		My goal was to explore that idea using IM data, in which the use of the words seems to be more intentional:
		while some would argue we &ldquo;automatically&rdquo; produce them in speech, using them in IM requires more conscious effort and thus may provide clues as to their discourse-pragmatic function.
		</p>

		<p>
		Apart from LVC, I'm also interested in the linguistics of Japanese: both in phonology (e.g., mora-timing) and in syntax/semantics (e.g., sluicing and island effects, internally-headed relative clauses, and adjectival modifiers).
		</p>

		<p> I grew up in London, Ontario and went to high school in Whitby, Ontario. I've been in Toronto since 2013, where I live with my partner, <a href="https://aileenlin.com" target = "external">Aileen</a>.</p>
		<p> Other than linguistics, some of my interests include <a href="https://uoftkendo.club" target = "external">kendo</a>, tea, poetry and other literature (reading and, occasionally, writing), taking pictures, and free and open software (GNU/Linux, etc.). I've been playing the violin since I was a kid and I love listening to and discovering new <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/cmonghost" target = "external">music</a>. I'm also extremely into <a href="images/koko.jpg" target = "external">dogs</a> and, more recently, birds.</p>
