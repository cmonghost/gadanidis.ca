<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi! I'm Tim Gadanidis
(/tɪm ˌgædəˈnidɪs/),
a Ph.D. student in linguistics at the University of Toronto.</p>

<p><a href=
    "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/1rodebvjw7estye/cv.pdf?dl%20=%200">
    You can download my CV here.</a></p>

<p>The rest of this page is organized as follows: <a href=
    "#lx">&#167;2</a> outlines my research interests and contains
links to download papers/slides. <a href="#personal">&#167;3</a>
provides a brief description of my personal info and
non-linguistic interests.</p>

<h2>Linguistics</h2><a name="lx"></a>

<h3>Research interests</h3>

<p>My research interests lie mostly in language variation and
change (LVC); that is, I study the social and linguistic
predictors that underlie language variation, as well as how that
variation leads to change over time. Particularly, I'm interested
in stylistic variation, discourse-pragmatic markers (especially
<em>um</em>, <em>uh</em> and other &#8220;sublexical&#8221;
markers like <em>hm</em>), subject drop, and anything to do with
language on the internet.</p>

<h4>Uh and um</h4>

<p>For my M.A. degree paper, I conducted a study of <em>um</em>
and <em>uh</em> in instant messaging (IM) under the supervision
of <a href="http://web.uvic.ca/~ddenis/Site/Derek_Denis.html"
    target="external">Derek Denis</a>.</p>

<p>Recent variationist work (e.g., <a href =
    "http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/22105832-00602001"
    target="external">Wieling et al., 2016</a>) has identified a
change in progress: <em>um</em> is rising in frequency relative
to <em>uh</em>, which might be related to an emerging functional
difference between the two. My goal was to explore that idea
using IM data, in which the use of the words seems to be more
intentional: while some would argue we
&#8220;automatically&#8221; produce them in speech, using them in
IM requires more conscious effort and thus may provide clues as
to their discourse-pragmatic function.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on extending the findings of my M.A.
paper with an experiment: I'm planning to use a matched-guise
design to identify listeners' social/interactional evaluations of
speakers depending on whether and how they use <em>uh</em>,
<em>um</em>, neither or both.</p>

<h4> Multiethnolect in Toronto </h4> --!>

<h4> Other research interests </h4>
<p>
Apart from LVC, I'm also interested in the linguistics of Japanese:
both in phonology (e.g., mora-timing) and in syntax/semantics
(e.g., sluicing and island effects, relative clauses, and adjectival modifiers).

<p> I grew up in London, Ontario and went to high school in Whitby, Ontario.
I've been in Toronto since 2013, where I live with my partner,
<a

</a>
and a rabbit named Lulu.</p>

<p> Other than linguistics, some of my interests include
<a href = "https://uoftkendo.club" target = "external">kendo</a>,
board games, taking pictures, and free and open software (GNU/Linux, etc.).
Lately I've been getting more into programming and am currently working on
learning Haskell.
I've played the violin since I was little and I love listening to and
discovering new music.
